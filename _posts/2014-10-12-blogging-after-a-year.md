Its been almost a year since I added a post in this blog. Lot of things have happened in the past one year. Its like nothing less than a roller coaster ride. I have become a father and author of my second book on Redis, [Redis Applied Design Patterns](http://bit.ly/1yPlraY "Redis design patterns"). 

Last weekend, I came under a revelation that i should write often in this blog and thought of revisting the blog. When I considered reasons for not writing often, it mostly boiled down to two things.

- I write in Markdown and converting markdown to HTML and then posting in wordpress was kind of tedious. I know there are plugins to do this but they were not so elegant.
- Felt that wordpress is too cumbersome to maintain a personal blog where I need less to no taxonomy. 

Around 5 months back, I experimented with Jekyll and found that very cool. The level of customizations and ease of using the platform was surely a plus. I will write more about my migration of blog from wordpress to jekyll in my next post.

For now, lets stick to the topic. In short, I migrated to Jekyll using HTML to markdown convertor and hosted the blog in Amazon S3 bucket. I tried couple of themes and settled with Minimal Mistakes with few minor changes to the theme files. I am quite happy with the output and I am writing this post in Markdown using my customized VIM. 

Now that i removed the excuse of not writing due to cumbersome process, I am planning to write more often even if the post is only a link to an article which i liked.
